# Hi, I'm Max

I'm looking forward to getting to know you! This document is not intended to replace or override the relationship and mutual understanding we will build as we work together. Its intention is to give you an idea of how I think and how I work.
It further helped me to identify and refine my thoughts and values.

## My role as a tech lead

I am here to make sure our team is successful, happy, and working on the things that are most important to help our customers, improve our product, and improve our business. More granularly:

### Market Data Platform

1.  I am making sure, that our team knows what are our clients need's and how to get them served. I believe that a happy client is the basis for our client relation.
2.  I am making sure, that we work on the right projects and have the right priorities.
3.  I am making sure, that our product domain is being visible to the rest of the organization.
4.  I write some code too (but looking at my latest commits, it seems to come to an end).

### Your development

1.  I am here to make sure you are both successful and happy: I want you to improve your technical skills, grow your career, enjoy your work, and believe in both our team's and our company's mission.
2.  I am here to make sure our team is successful and pointed in the right direction. You might hear Marvin talking about [his apache project](https://incubator.apache.org/projects/marvin.html): I am here to make sure our team is all aligned and pushing in the same direction.
3.  You‚Äôre very good at your job. You wouldn‚Äôt be here if you weren‚Äôt. If it feels like I‚Äôm questioning you it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm either: a) Trying to gather context. Or b) Trying to be a sounding board and rubber duck.

### Add-On

These are in approximate order of importance. If you are not successful and happy, our team is not successful (or happy). If our team is struggling, writing code will most likely not be my top priority.

Additionally: My job is _not_ to tell you exactly what to do and how to do it. It is also not to be the "official decision maker" for our team. "I am _accountable_ for the decisions the team make, even if I‚Äôm not the one making them most of the time." 

Let me know when you are stuck and need my help. One of my main responsibilities is ensuring that you‚Äôre set up for success. Occasionally things slip through the cracks and I won‚Äôt know I‚Äôm letting you down.

I might have thoughts on your code. In the end, you own your code and if you have a good reason for doing something, you should do it.

## Feedback

If you have feedback for me, please give it. It could be something you liked and would like to see more of, something you thought I could do better, something you thought I totally screwed up, or something that doesn't fit in any of these categories. Even if you think it might not be the case, I _do_ want to hear it. And if you think I don't want to hear it, I'd love to hear why you feel that way.

If you can give me this feedback in-person, I'd prefer that. If you're only comfortable kicking off a discussion with an email or a Slack message, I would rather you do that than not bring it up at all.

Similarly, if you have feedback for a team member, I encourage you to give it to them directly; if you're not comfortable doing so, please feel free to relay it to me to pass along.

If you want to give direct feedback but aren't sure how or aren't comfortable doing so, let me know and we can talk through it.

## One-on-ones

I will put thirty minutes on your calendar each week for a one-on-one. If you need more time, let me know and I will adjust. 
I will probably schedule our first one-on-one for an hour just to be sure we have time to go over the team mission and other introductory things; don't feel the need to prepare for it.

One-on-ones are _your time_. I will probably have some things to discuss with you, but this is first and foremost your opportunity to let me know how you're doing, what you need, what you wish could be different, how you feel about our team and your teammates, what your career goals are... etc. These are for the conversations you might not necessarily have with me when we're sitting at our desks amongst coworkers. If you'd like to give me a brief status update on things you're working on or that you're stuck on, that is fine with me, but those are generally better-suited to a quick chat while I'm at my desk, an @ on a Github/Gitlab issue, a Slack message, or a separate meeting.

I encourage you to write down some things throughout the week that you want to chat about if you think that will help; it can be hard to think of or bring up things in the moment. If you have things you want to talk about but struggle with bringing them up, feel free to send me a vague agenda ahead of time. If you don't know what to talk about, say so. We can use that as a topic.

### Performance

I will give you feedback on how you're doing in our one-on-ones. If I'm worried about your performance, I will let you know. If you worry that I'm worried about your performance, please let me know.

## My schedule

When I am working from the office, you can usually expect me to be around between 9am and 6pm. I am often in earlier or later than that, but with some exceptions these tend to be the hours you can count on finding me. I often will continue working from home in the evenings on in-office days once I get dinner going.

I usually work from home once a week, and will mark this in my Slack status üè°. 

I prefer to do one-on-ones in person if possible, so if you need to work from home on a day we're scheduled for a one-on-one and rescheduling is an option, please let me know so I can reschedule it, or reschedule it yourself during an open slot in my calendar.

### After-hours communication

I will get a sense of your normal working hours as we begin working together, and I will make a strong effort not to message you outside of these hours because I know many people have Slack notifications sent to their phone. I will sometimes send emails outside of your working hours (especially if we're in different time zones), as emails don't tend to notify people quite as intrusively. You should not feel obligated to read or respond to any emails or messages you receive from me outside of your normal hours. If you are receiving after-hours messages from me with any frequency, please let me know‚Äîit may mean I'm misunderstanding the hours you normally work.

If for any reason I do urgently need you outside of your normal working hours, I will page you. This will happen _extremely_ rarely (if ever).

Similarly, if you email or Slack me outside of my working hours, I may not respond quickly. I do try to keep up with notifications in case there's anything urgent, but if I read a message and it's non-urgent, I may leave it until then. If you have something non-urgent you want to tell me and it's outside of my work hours, I don't mind if you Slack me, though I always appreciate an explicit note that it's non-urgent! If you need me urgently outside of work hours, paging me is the best way to get hold of me, though you can always try Slack too first.

## If you need something

1.  Snag me at my desk. If I have headphones on, it does _not_ mean I am "in the zone" and expect not to be interrupted. I'm probably just enjoying some music. Feel free to grab my attention, preferably by waving in my periphery or tapping my desk. If I'm about to have to run off for a meeting or are "in the zone", I'll let you know and figure out a better time to chat.
2.  Slack me or email me. Even if you want an in-person meeting, just message me to let me know you want to talk and I'll make time. If you would rather talk about something over email or message, that's fine too.
3.  Throw something on my calendar. If I am scheduled for an interview or something else I can't reschedule and you invite me to a meeting, I may chat with you and reschedule. 
4.  If you see that I've blocked off the day or time block as "meeting-free", that does not apply to you‚Äîit's more to discourage folks from scheduling non-urgent meetings that day that could be scheduled otherwise. If you need to talk, schedule over this as much as you need.

If I'm working from home, you can expect me to be as available as I would be if I was in the office. Although it may feel weird to schedule a brief Slack meeting when you'd normally just swing by my desk for five minutes, please do so without hesitation if you think chatting face-to-face or screen-sharing will be more useful than textual communication.

## Expectations of you

While this document is meant to focus on how I work and what to expect from me, I will give you a hint what I expect from you:

* Do amazing work. This is the expectation. Let me know if there is something preventing you from accomplishing this.

* Disagree with me. The best solutions comes from a healthy level of debate. We need to be able to separate our ideas from our egos. I‚Äôll challenge your ideas with the goal of coming to the best possible solution, I hope you‚Äôll challenge mine.

* Tell me when I screw up. This is very important. I screw up and sometimes don‚Äôt notice. I need to know or I‚Äôll likely do it again.

* Communicate. One of my jobs is to provide context. Are you missing some? Let me know and I‚Äôll fill you in or go find out.

* Bring your friends. We‚Äôre growing the team and you know who you want to work with.

## My interests

Here are some things I love. If you ever want to strike up casual conversation and don't know what to talk about, these are good bets :smiley:

* Football. Yes, I mean the real football, not what some people call "soccer". If in any case you are a fan of the worlds best football club, Borussia Dortmund, that is a huge plus point.
I am always up for a chat about latest transfer rumors, the latest Bundesliga, Champions League or Europe League games - especially combined with a cold beer.

* Sports. Besides watching football, I am also very active in doing it (although some doubt so)!. I am in for everything starting from running, calisthenics and boxing. If you are interested to talk or even better do some of the activities with me, you are more than welcome.

* Beer and food. As of my German roots, I can not skip a well-tasting, cold beer. Preferibly combined with some honest food. If you know a good place or want to have me join your evening, it is hard to say _no_ for me.
